\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The ability to monitor and predict crop yields in developing countries
is critical to the successful adaptation to changes in our climate.
Increased temperatures and variability has already been linked to losses
in maize and wheat yields (-3.8 and 5.5\% respectively)and crop prices
globally {[}1{]}. Although much effort has been placed on modeling the
spatial distribution of these shifts, less effort has been placed on how
yields vary across space and time {[}2{]}. Advances in remote sensing
provide avenues to monitor agricultural crop health at high spatial and
temporal resolution. However, our ability to monitor changes in plant
productivity is still limited in the more complex environments common to
many developing countries {[}3{]}.

Remote sensing based efforts to characterize the extent, cultivation
practices, and productivity of global croplands has a long history. In
fact, agricultural monitoring motivated much of the earliest work in
remote sensing for example NASA's LACIE and AgRISTARS programs in the
1970s and 1980s and {[}4{]}). Since then, substantial progress has been
made in mapping cropland extent, crop types, irrigation status, cropping
intensity, and productivity from remotely sensed imagery. For example,
the MODIS Land Cover Product MCD12Q1 {[}8{]} provides operationally
produced, global scale maps of agriculture and agricultural-natural
mosaics at an annual time step and 500 m spatial resolution from
2001-present. A finer resolution (\textasciitilde{}30 m) dataset is
available for the conterminous United States which maps the annual
extent and type for over 250 crops using primarily Landsat imagery: the
Cropland Data Layer {[}{[}10{]}. These are but two prominent examples
out of a broad literature documenting a wide variety of efforts to map
cropland extent and type from remotely sensed imagery {[}11{]}. Remotely
sensed imagery has also been employed to map irrigated areas {[}17{]},
and cropping frequency/intensity {[}16{]}.

Initial efforts (e.g.~LACIE and AgRISTARS) primarily utilized remotely
sensed imagery to characterize the spatial extent and growth stage of
crops, but relied on models driven chiefly by meteorological information
to predict crop yield {[}21{]}. However, the biophysical link between
canopy spectral reflectance and net primary production has long been
established {[}23{]}; indicating that satellite measurements could play
a role in determining crop yield directly. Indeed, early experimental
work confirmed the usefulness of spectral measurements in predicting LAI
and intercepted PAR in crops {[}24{]}, a result that was later extended
to satellite measurements of spectral reflectance {[}27{]}. Spectral
measurements typically explain variability in LAI and intercepted PAR
better than crop yields because a variety of factors other than net
primary production (e.g.~weather during critical crop growth stages)
influence yield. Nevertheless, a wide number of studies have documented
highly explanatory empirical relationships between satellite measures
such as NDVI (in many forms: growing season maximum and mean, seasonally
integrated, etc.) and yields for a variety of crops, particularly at
regional scales {[}30{]}. Because certain crop growth stages are
particularly critical for final yield {[}36{]}, improved results are
often seen when remotely sensed data are used to characterize crop
phenology {[}37{]}. More recently, methods for forecasting yields with
remotely sensed variables at the field scale have been explored
{[}38{]}. In addition to establishing a direct relationship between
satellite measurements and crop yield, combining these observations with
model output, through formal or ad hoc data assimilation techniques has
also been demonstrated {[}40{]}.

The main objectives of this paper is to
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. In particular, we will focus on the
application of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. We also created
and present a suite of algorithms used to extract, summarize, and
organize remotely sensed data and prepare it for spatiotemporal
analysis.

\subsection{Drought meets
distribution}\label{drought-meets-distribution}

Spured by a long history of monsoon failures across the Sahel,
forecasters and aid teams axiciously watched eastern Africa at the onset
of a significant El Nino event in late 2014. Below average rainfalls in
2015-17 across the low lying pastoral communities and South Eastern
Ethiopia triggered an international effort to provide food aid to
roughly 8.5 million people in the summer of 2017 {[}43{]}. The
understated response from the Ethiopian government has lead to
accusations that the government is downplaying the severity of the
drought as early as 2016 {[}45{]}. Despite the reality of a severe and
crippling drought in food insecure low lying areas, there is little sign
of food shortages nationally, with a recent study observing no
significant change in grain prices throughout the country
((((\textbf{???})))). The lack of a price response would indicate that
while food insecure areas were hit heavily by water shortages largely
effecting livestock, leaving the highland areas largely unaffected or
triggering only minor losses. Despite international concern, conditions
up until the 2016-2017 growing season may have been largely handled by
domestic resources and trade flows, therefore requiring shifts in
distribution rather than a large-scale interational intervention.

Looking at the example of wheat production for the top 15 producing
zones (Figure: 1), we can see that total output has remained steady or
increased in the majority of top performing zones. This can be seen by
the increase in total production from 49,500 (?00s quintiles) in 2010 to
64,209 in the 2015 planting season. Additionally, we can see that the
total production of each zone (as indicated by the width of each bar)
generally increases over time, or remains relatively constant. Moreover
we can see that the rank of regions (as indicated by the plot order,
bottom being lowest rank, top being highest rank) remains surprisingly
steady dispite the exogenous shock of drought begining in the 2015
planing season.

\emph{Figure 1: Total wheat output of top 15 producing zones in tons}

\texttt{r}\includegraphics{/home/mmann1123/Documents/IFPRI_Ethiopia_Drought_2016/Visualizations/Wheat_Output_bottom40_rm_acd_v2.jpg}

We can see from Figure 2 three time series for the major regions
depicting the drought, in the top panel (a) the percentage of planted
area damaged by damage type, the middle panel (b) the percentage of area
planted in each major crop, in the bottom panel (c) median output per
hectare (OPH) in quintiles for each major crop. Although we see a marked
spike in reports of drought damage in the 2015 planting season (covering
harvest in 2016), we see a few important responses. First, we see that
although slight, farmers increased the percentage of area planted in
drought tolerant crops such as maize and sorghum. Second, we see that
although some regions saw declines in median output per hectare, these
losses are largely offset by gains in other crops or by the steady
increase in OPH since 2010.

Moreover Ethiopia has rapidly improved its ability to mitigate food
insecurity through trade flows. International and intranational trade
has likely been improved by the rapid development of the paved road
network, and with the opening of the Ethiopia-Djibouti electric railway
line in 2016 improving trade with this red sea port. Even in 2011, for
the case of wheat, we can see how imports and internal trade flows move
wheat from surplus areas to defict areas. In Figure 3, we see large
international imports as well as comprehensive internal trade flows at
the zonal level.

\emph{Figure 3: 2011 aggregate wheat trade flows at the zonal level}

\texttt{r}\includegraphics{/home/mmann1123/Documents/IFPRI_Ethiopia_Drought_2016/Writeup/ggplot_grey_legend_import.png}

Although far from perfect we should acknowledge substantial improvements
in Ethiopia's ability to mitigate and respond to localized drought.
